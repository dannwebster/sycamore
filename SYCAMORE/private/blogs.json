She holds a Master’s Degree in Educational Leadership and Policy Studies, as well as a Multiple Subject Teaching Credential.  First beginning her career at the Walt Disney Company as a recruiter, she pursued her passion for teaching in 1998 and soon landed at the prestigious Buckley School in Sherman Oaks as a 6th grade teacher.  A valued member of the Buckley faculty and popular with her students, Christy helped plan and orchestrate the 6th grade outdoor educational program.  She was also instrumental in the creation of a diversity initiative round table for the Buckley faculty.  Most recently, she developed procedures for newly hired personnel.  Her connection with her students was recognized in 2011 when she was awarded the Buckley School’s Parent’s Association Award – which gave her the opportunity to study in Peru.  Later in 2012, she was also awarded the National Junior Honor Society Teacher of the Year Award.  Having increasingly developed a teaching philosophy around integrated, project-based learning, Christy left Buckley in 2012 to teach 4th and 5th grade at Los Encinos School, where this teaching philosophy is part of the daily curriculum.  With this experience, Christy now begins a new chapter as a co-founder of Catalyst Education, a team that is focused on revolutionizing education.  Christy and her partners most recently presented at Archer School for Girls STEM conference, the Milken Community School Playful Learning Summit, and the Games in Education conference.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p><h3 class=\"fr-tag\">TEDD WAKEMAN </h3><p class=\"fr-tag\"><img alt=\"Image title\" class=\"fr-image-dropped fr-fil fr-dii fr-tag\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sycamore-la/forum/eb419926-365b-4d4f-ba6c-f4c2bf4f46c2.png\" width=\"300\"> Tedd Wakeman has been working with children in education, recreation, and research for two decades. He worked locally with LAUSD, teaching inner-city youth at the elementary level for 13 years, while concurrently traveling the country teaching and developing STEM curriculum for Nike/Eco Educators. Tedd has also taught extensively across the globe. He worked in the Republic of the Maldives, teaching English to groups of adults from over 25 different nations while diving the local coral reefs as a divemaster. In Bali, he lived and worked with Indonesian rice farmers, implementing permaculture practices while utilizing a distance education program created through Queensland, Australia to educate local teenagers. Tedd went on to spend two years in Costa Rica where he taught 4th-5th grade, while exploring local rainforest ecosystems. After these varied approaches and experiences in the field of education, he returned to Los Angeles and joined the GameDesk team in founding the revolutionary PlayMaker School.  PlayMaker gained notoriety for its unique approach to 21st Century learning and game-based curriculum.  With Tedd's current adventure, the founding of The Sycamore School, he hopes to preserve the spirit of creativity and curiosity in elementary-aged students as they grow and transition to middle school.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><strong><u>Office Manager:</u></strong></p><h3 class=\"fr-tag\">KARLA REYES-COOPER</h3><p class=\"fr-tag\"><img alt=\"Image title\" class=\"fr-fir fr-dii fr-tag\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sycamore-la/forum/f9ae87a0-0c0b-46b6-99dd-2f52665b1624.png\" width=\"300\"></p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p><p class=\"fr-tag\">Born and raised in Mexico City, Karla moved to Pasadena, CA at the age of 13 where she remained through high school.
